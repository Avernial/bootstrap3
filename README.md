# Bootstrap3 for OJS 3.0

A community-built theme for OJS 3.0 that implements Bootstrap 3 components.

_This theme is a work-in-progress and needs your contributions_.

## Project Aims

This project was born at the [2016 PKP Sprint](https://pkp.sfu.ca/2016/04/29/sprinting-in-montreal/) in Montreal. It aims to provide a common starting point for anyone who wants to build a custom theme for OJS 3.0.

The goal was to stay true to Bootstrap 3's core component, so that developers familiar with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework can more easily read and customize the code base. By sticking close to Bootstrap 3's supported components, the theme is able to more easily leverage the many existing Bootstrap 3 resources out there.

## Installation

Once this theme is stable it will be available for installation from your OJS 3.0 plugin browser. Until then, there are two ways to install it.

```
cd /path/to/your/ojs/plugins/themes
git clone https://github.com/NateWr/bootstrap3.git
```

Alternatively, you can [download a zip] of the master branch. Unpack the `.zip` file in the `/plugins/themes/` directory in your OJS 3.0 installation. _Make sure the resulting directory is `bootstrap3`, not `bootstrap3-master`_.

## Contribution

This theme is a work-in-progress. It may not support all features of OJS 3.0 and some of the bundled themes could use some polish. It's intended to act as a base for custom development, but many journals may use it out-of-the-box.

If you see something that could be improved, please issue a Pull Request.
